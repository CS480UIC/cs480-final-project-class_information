Teachers will be able to create "Classes". Within classes, Teachers can add/delete assignments, upload files, and grade assignmetns for students. Students will be invited to classrooms and then will be given the abilitiy to access all public content, submit assignments, and view their own grades. With this content management system, Teachers and Students can have a more fluid process in regards to student-class interactions.
