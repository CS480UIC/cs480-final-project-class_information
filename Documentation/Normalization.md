1st Normal Form: We checked that all our tables have a primary key and made sure there are no duplicate columns from the same table.
2nd Normal Form: We made sure that the subset of data that applies to multiple rows of a table are in separate tables and have the relationship of foreign keys.
3rd Normal Form: We made sure that no columns that are not dependent upon the primary key.
Boyce-Codd Normal Form: We made sure every determinant must be a candidate key as they are IDs of each table which must be unique.
